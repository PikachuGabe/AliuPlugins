# 1.3.0
Added bluesky support because I noticed it uses `@` instead of `.` when denoting file type. Not updating plugin name as that would break the updater.

# 1.2.0
Fixed the plugin. Again.
Now downloads directly from twitter instead of through discord's external image stuff.

# 1.1.0
Fixed the plugin.
Switched to regex for file renaming.
Renamed plugin at Rushii's request.

# 1.0.0
Plugin release
